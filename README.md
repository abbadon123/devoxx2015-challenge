## Task

Welcome at ACME company, we're selling a ton of great stuff here!
We need you to finish our `OfferService` so we can respond to our clients' needs.
The aim of our `/offers` endpoint is to serve only the coolest (and prettiest) things.
You'll receive events representing cool stuff being created at our shop,
but you have to check their photos before serving them to our users! 
Remember - we classify photo as pretty only when our super-clever REST PhotoScoreService
returns score greater or equal 0.7. 

## Prerequisites

You only need Java 8 to solve this task.

## How to

* fork this repository and clone it,
* code, code, code...
* check if tests are green by running `./gradlew test` (or using your favourite IDE),
* create pull-request, so Travis can start the build.

Make it your own work - we don't like cheaters!
